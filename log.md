### Day 13: January 3rd, Friday
**Today's Progress**: shared script designed parse through a list of csv files, format them using pd.melt and then concatenate or append them to one file, outputting a single csv with all the records combined.

### Day 11: January 1st, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: shared post about f-strings and string formatting

### Day 10: December 31st, Tuesday

### Day 9: December 30th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: committed to #dailycoding challenge

### Day 8: September 25th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: created a notebook in databricks to practice using various functions in pyspark (split, explode, row, etc)



### Day 7: September 13th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: edited password manager to also be able to generate passwords randomly and then store them for later  

**Thoughts** the password generator was similar to a project we had in data analysis bootcamp; the difference here is simply combining it with the password manager to store the random password for later.

### Day 6: September 12th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: wrote a script to build a password manager to store passwords(a terrible idea, but a good exercise nonethless

**Thoughts** Practiced using argparse to run functions in CLI (again, with this function)


### Day 2: September 8th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: wrote a simple script to semi-automate a process (comparing fields from two csv files)

**Thoughts** Practiced using argparse to run functions in CLI.

### Day 1: September 7th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started a series on youtube about making code more consistent with standards .

**Thoughts** Practiced using argparse to run functions in CLI.
