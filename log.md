# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 7: September 13th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: edited password manager to also be able to generate passwords randomly and then store them for later  

**Thoughts** the password generator was similar to a project we had in data analysis bootcamp; the difference here is simply combining it with the password manager to store the random password for later.
